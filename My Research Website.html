        <h2>What is gardening and why is it important?</h2>
        <p>•	Gardening is the practice of cultivating plants, both flowers and vegetables, in a garden to enhance their growth and beauty. </p>
        <p>•	It's important for various reasons, including providing fresh, healthy food, reducing environmental impact, improving mental and physical well-being, and enriching communities. </p>
        <p>•	Gardening helps us grow our own healthy food instead of always buying it from stores. It teaches us to be more independent and think differently about what we eat.</p>
        <p>•	It’s also good for starting a business of your own, selling the food you have plated to make profit or being a supplier to a company that can sell what is in your garden.</p>

	<h1>Challenges include:</h1>
	<h2>1. Pests and Diseases</h2>
    </div>
		<p>•	Small pests like caterpillars, aphids, whiteflies, and slugs might look harmless at first—but they can quickly eat leaves, stems, or roots and weaken or kill the plant. These pests often hide under leaves or in the soil, so you might not notice them until your plants are already damaged.</p>
		<p>•	Fruits, vegetables, and young plants often attract animals such as birds, squirrels, rabbits, and deer. Birds may peck at tomatoes or steal seeds, while deer or rabbits can eat entire plants overnight. Rodents like rats and mice may dig around roots or nibble on produce.</p>
		<p>Solution:</p>
		<p>•	Use natural pest control</p>
		<p>o	Mix water with a little dish soap and spray it on leaves to remove aphids or whiteflies.</p>
		<p>o	Neem oil or garlic spray can also help keep bugs away without harming the plant. </p>
		<p>•	Check plants regularly</p>
		<p>o	Look under leaves and around the soil for early signs of pests or mold. Catching problems early can save the whole plant.</p>
		<p>•	Rotate crops</p>
		<p>o	Don’t grow the same plants in the same spot every season. This reduces the risk of soil-borne diseases and pests that stay in the ground.</p>
